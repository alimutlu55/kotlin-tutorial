/*
The name of runBlocking means that the thread that runs it (in this case â€” the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call,
until all the coroutines inside runBlocking { ... } complete their execution.
You will often see runBlocking used like that at the very top-level of the application and quite rarely inside the real code,
as threads are expensive resources and blocking them is inefficient and is often not desired.
